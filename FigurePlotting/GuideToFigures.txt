Figure 1: Zac made this.  In principle, this can be made from scripts he wrote plus data files for the 120 and 160 MHz beams, which should be added to the repo.  

Figure 2: Also made by Zac, but in principle also derivable from the E-field beams as the sum of of the elements.  Need a script for this.

Figure 3: The antenna positions.  plot_antpos_hera19.py.  

Figure 4: RFI occupancy.  We don't have a script that does this.  ***Paul L P will generate an occupancy script.

Figures 10, 11: plot_real_sim_compare.ipynb. This used the same real and sim data files as figs 8, 9

Figure 12: plot_noise_estimation.ipynb.  Used data from /lustre/aoc/projects/hera/plaplant/HERA19Golden/CalibratedData/LSThrs_10.5_23.0/FREQrng_150_350/zen.2457548.16700_66112.pI.HH.uvcRPCS.uvh5.UVP.  This was saved in intermediate files easier to load in /lustre/aoc/projects/hera/plaplant/HERA19Golden/CalibratedData/LSThrs_10.5_23.0/FREQrng_150_350/24575??_LST_10_23_lowband_pI.uvh5.UVP
